## Setup/Installation

### LINUX

Optimization uses Gurobi's python package. To use the Gurobi model install
Gurobi onto your local machine here:

https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/

This will require you to create an account and if you are planning on using
a net licence create a file called `gurobi.lic` in an accessible location
and type the following into a terminal window:

> export GRB_LICENSE_FILE=[__path__]/gurobi.lic

Install the Gurobi Python Module via terminal

> pip install gurobipy
> or
> pip3 install gurobipy

### MAC/OSX

@TODO

### WINDOWS

Assuming you have Python,

Download Gurobi from https://gurobi.com/downloads/ You need the Gurobi Optimizer.  You will need to register.
Set up your Gurobi license (see below).

Install the Gurobi Python Module via terminal

> pip install gurobipy
> or
> pip3 install gurobipy

Insert the following at the beginning of your python program

`import gurobipy as gp`

`from gurobipy import GRB`

and any other modules needed.
Now the python program can call Gurobi.

## Gurobi site license

Create a token server client license. It is a license file (_denoted with `.lic` extension_) created with any word editor

```
Name: gurobi.lic
Location: a default/accesible location on your computer, e.g., C:\Users\Mike.Veatch\Documents

Contents:
TOKENSERVER=gurobi.gordon.edu
  or
TOKENSERVER=172.27.43.55
```

(note) this IP address may not be permanent.
You must be on the Gordon network (on campus or VPN) to use this license.

For testing, you may want to add a line that change the timeout in case the token server is unavailable. The default value is 30 seconds.
SERVERTIMEOUT=10

## Overview of Code

The code is divided into five major functions. However, like the paper, most variables are global, so they only have one meaning and are used in several functions. A few things are passed as arguments so the same code can process them. Other variables are arguments for no reason.

The functions appear first. Execution begins with the code that reads the CMD line (near end of the file).

```
main() # initialization, search over lambda (outer loop), compute additional outputs after optimizing, and
  # write outputs
  call import_xml() to read inputs
  initialize: output filename and directory, policy, state variables, LP variables, etc.
  if simulate_only = 0
    # outer loop (searches over values of lambda, which is a multiplier penalizing infections)
    initialize for outer loop
    iteration i = 0: call optimize_inner()
      # not used in the minimization to avoid bias from initial policy
    iteration i = 1: call optimize_inner()
      # same lambda as iteration 0 but updated policy
    iteration i = 2: call optimize_inner()
    phase 1 iterate over i (change lambda in same direction until past min)
      call optimize_inner()
    phase 2 iterate over i (golden ratio search for lambda in an interval)
      call optimize_inner()



    # write outputs
    write csv file (optimize)
  if verbosity > 0: write input echo to output file
  if simulate_only = 0: write outputs (optimize)


  else   # simulate only
    for each area
      set policy to give priority to this area
      call simulate()
      record results of simulation
     write results of simulation
  for each area
    write vaccinations from simulation

  opt_inner() # inner loop over j: solves LP approximation, simulates, updates approximation, iterates
  if outer iteration i = 0

    call simulate() # first sim
    record first sim results for output
    set t_LP (time that infections are counted in LP)
    initialize min solution and opt solution
  if i > 0 and phase = 1
    initial j = 0 solution is the best solution from i = 0
    set alpha (transmission rate), V_cal (effective number infectious), V (vaccinations) using previous.
  # Used by LP.
  if phase = 2
    initial j = 0 solution is the best solution from previous i
    set alpha, V_cal, V using min. Used by LP.
  initialize for j loop: j = 0, set t_LP

    increment j, LP_count
    call solve_LP() # improving = 1: LP uses alpha, V_cal for the best policy found so far in this inner loop
     # improving = 0: LP uses alpha, V_cal for the policy from the last LP

    check that optimal solution was found
    update the policy V using the LP solution V1
    call simulate()
    record sim results

    compute dVmin, dVmax (change in V_cal, used to check convergence)

    initialize t_sim (time variant appears in sim), variant_emerge flag

    for t = 0,…, T-1 # loop over day

      else: transmission rate is constant

      compute V_cal[a, t], delta_E[a, t], and V_star[a, t] (vacc w/o reallocation) for this t

      reallocate unused vaccinations to other areas, up to their vacc limits Wnew, in priority order
        (store vacc w/o realloc in V_minus[a], then update V_star[a, t])
      compute next states using difference equations
      check if variant emerges at this t, using nondonor areas

    compute V_cal at final time T
    if simulate_only: write csv file

## Versions

### Current

seir_opt.py optimizes using iterative LPs or simulates

### Deprecated Versions

seir_opt2.py optimizes using iterative LPs or simulates

seirQP3.py

optimizes using QP (at each lambda) or simulates.

Recent changes:

```
  MIPgap=.02
  time limit=600s for each QP
  record results of QP if status == GRB.TIME_LIMIT
  clarified output: suboptimal QP results are counted if time limit reached,
	removed unused column
  console output is redirected to output file ..._con.out using sys.stdout
  output file name changed to include values of T and nu, e.g.,
	T2_T090_nu0.0.out
	To change which parameters are in name, look for fn_base
  csv file name changed from plot_....csv to ..._plot.csv
```

## Usage

If the input simulate_only = 1, several policies are simulated, one with priority given to each area.
If simulate_only = 0, LPs are solved repeatedly searching for an optimal policy. A simulation is done before each LP is solved.

To run, give the name of the FOLDER containing input files:

> python seir_opt input_data

This does multiple runs, one for each file in this folder. Old versions did a single run, given the path to the input file. To read T2.xml in the folder "input_data":

> python seir_opt input_data/T2.xml

---

### Controlling outputs

The subfolder "output" is created. For each input file, seir_opt writes two or three files, e.g.,

```
  C2.3_nu0.0.out		output
  C2.3_nu0.0_con.out		console output, i.e., Gurobi
  C2.3_nu0.0_plot.csv		csv file for time plots with R
```

The output file names are the input file name, followed by the value of the input "nu".

Note that output files are overwritten if the same input and nu are used.

To change which input is added to the file name, edit "fn_base = ..."

To direct Gurobi output to console, remove "sys.stdout = ..."

To turn off console (Gurobi) output, change v.Params.LogToConsole from 1 to 0

## The simulate_only and verbosity input control what appears in the output file:

### Optimization

```
verbosity >= 0: results for first sim, optimal, "min" (best LP for last lambda)
verbosity >= 1: echo inputs, vaccinations by day/area
verbosity >= 2: outer and inner loop showing progress of algorithm
```

### Simulate only

```
verbosity >= 0: sim results for each priority policy
verbosity >= 1: echo inputs, vaccinations by day/area
```

## Input Format

All inputs and computed constants are global, defined in:import_xml (denoted global:import_xml)

				0 if LP uses alpha, V_cal for the policy from the last LP
```

## Outputs

The subfolder "output" is created. For each input file, seir_opt2 writes two or threee files, e.g.,

```
  C2.3_tsw180.out		output
  C2.3_tsw180_con.out		console output, i.e., Gurobi
  C2.3_tsw180_plot.csv		csv file for time plots with R
```

seir_QP3 appends "\_QP" to the names.

To direct Gurobi output to console, remove "sys.stdout = ..."

To turn off console (Gurobi) output, change v.Params.LogToConsole from 1 to 0

The verbosity input controls what goes in the output file:

```
verbosity >= 0: echo inputs, first sim, optimal, "min" (best LP for last lambda)
verbosity >= 1: vaccinations by day/area
verbosity >= 2: outer and inner loop showing progress of algorithm
```

For QP, the outputs are a subset of this:

```
verbosity >= 0: echo inputs, first sim, optimal
verbosity >= 1: vaccinations by day/area
verbosity >= 2: outer loop showing progress of algorithm
```

## When simulate_only = 1, the initial policy is simulated and a csv file is written. Other output for this option hasn't been done.

## Plots

Open time_plots.Rmd in RStudio. It uses the packages tidyverse, tidyr, dplyr. If you haven't installed these, add the install statements

```
  install.packages("tidyverse")
  install.packages("tidyr")
  install.packages("dplyr")
```

before the library statements.

Change the read.csv statement to give the path to your csv file, e.g.,

sim1 = read.csv("~/research/vaccine/code/output/C2.3_plot.csv")

The first chunk creates large plots, two for each area. Also run the second chunk to get smaller plots that are readable in black and white.

### Notes

1. You can open the data file with Import/From text (base) in the Environment window, but then you need to rename the data frame. Look in the environment to see the data frame name. Uncomment the statement, e.g.,

sim1 = C2.3_plot

2. To change which variables are plotted, edit the filter statement, e.g.,

```
filter(state == "Infectious" | state == "Deaths"   | state == "Cases"
         | state == "Vaccinations" | state == "Susceptible") |>
```

There must be |> (the native pipe) at the end. To see the list of variables, after running the chunk look at the state column of the data frame sim_long. It includes all the state variables, plus some that were computed in R:

```
mutate(Infectious = I + IV)
mutate(Cases = E + EV + I + IV + H + R + D)
mutate(Vaccinations = cumsum(V)
```

Note that Cases, Recovered, Deaths, and Vaccinations are cumulative, while others are not. Omitting variables that take on large values, such as Cases, will zoom in on the smaller variables. To rename variables (e.g., to change "SV" to "Susceptible Vacc"), edit the recode statement:

sim_long$state = recode(sim_long$state, "H" = "Hospitalized", "R"="Recovered",
"D" = "Deaths", "S" = "Susceptible")

The x-axis has tick marks every 10 days; see the comments to change this.

All areas have dashed vertical lines at
t_n = day variant appears
t_n + L = day variant spreads to other areas
Each area should only have one line, but I don't know how to do different lines on different plots.
